    "\n",
    "This Jupyter notebook contains a prototype extractive text summarization method developed as a part of NIST's participation in the IARPA TrojAI Project to help accelerate the manual summarization of TrojAI-related literature being curated at the [TrojAI Literature Review GitHub repository](https://github.com/usnistgov/trojai-literature). For each document, our method identifies sentences containing certain metadiscourse markers and then ranks them using this [implementation](https://pypi.org/project/lexrank/) of the [LexRank](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/project/jair/pub/volume22/erkan04a-html/erkan04a.html) algorithm. We then emit the top-ranked sentences as a summary of the paper."
